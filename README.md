### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Royce Williams. By day, I work in information security. When I'm not at $DAYJOB, [Tech Solvency](https://www.techsolvency.com) is the shingle under which I work and conduct security research. I live in Anchorage, Alaska with my family.

I am a public-interest technologist at heart. I believe that the keepers and operators of technology and data should first do no harm (though second-order effects mean trade-offs - for example, a surgeon does some "harm" cutting into a patient, for the patient's own good).

Most of my GitHub work centers around password cracking, including some UX and minor housekeeping work on [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat). I have been [a member of Team Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/docs/team.txt) (hashcat's password-cracking competition group) since 2016. I also collaborate with other teams and groups.

I have a more thorough bio, including links to projects and research, [here](https://www.techsolvency.com/roycewilliams/).
